              On a case-by-case basis, Services may be made available to you for
              a trial review period at the sole discretion of Whizlabs (
              <strong>"Review Period"</strong>). During the Review Period, you
              will be provided access to the Services without charge. If your

              offered for trial review will be terminated if payment is not made
              prior to the end of the Review Period. Termination of a Service

              substitute or proxy for a paid Service, it may immediately
              terminate or suspend your access to the applicable Service for

            <li>
              If your access to a Course is terminated due to you not purchasing
              a Course Subscription, and then Whizlabs subsequently reinstates
              your access to the Course upon later receiving payment, any such
              reinstated access shall remain subject to the terms of this EULA.
