Whereas Prince2 defines the roles of everyone involved in a project, PMP&reg; focuses only on the project manager&rsquo;s role.</p>\r\n<p>People in senior management should go for PgMP (Program Management) or PMI-RMP (Risk Management Professional). Those who have the understanding of agile methodology/concepts and are working with project teams that are specifically devised for agile practices should go for PMI-ACP&reg;.</p>\r\n<p>The Scrum Master helps the team in its use of Scrum. He is like a trainer, who will provide motivation while at the same time making sure you are honest with your work. The trainer&rsquo;s authority, however, is limited. He cannot make you do your work, he can only guide you.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on your qualification, experience, and interest you can opt for any certification.</p>",
